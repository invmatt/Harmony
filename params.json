It's built using clean semantic HTML5 with no\r\nadditional un-needed markup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmony was developed as many \"for developer\" clean slate themes always include alot of unnecessary markup, JS\r\nand custom functions. Harmony does as little as possible and only includes the basics to actually render the site</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmony does include a very basic SASS framework which handles the reset etc and Custom Meta Boxes, these folders can be\r\nquickly deleted and replaced with alternatives if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Special thanks to:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes\">Humanmade</a> for Custom Meta Boxes</li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/KNACSS-Sass\">Hugo Giraudel</a> for the SASS version of <a href=\"http://www.knacss.com\">KNACSS</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Changelog:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    v1.0.0\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Initial release</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
