<h3>A Lightweight Development Theme for WordPress</h3>

<p>Harmony is a lightweight, minimal style wordpress theme for developers. It's built using clean semantic HTML5 with no additional bloat.</p>

<p>Harmony was developed as many developer/clean slate themes included large unnecessary function files, custom content and markup leaving you to spend time stripping out everything you don't need rather than focusing on developing the theme<p>

<p>I have included a basic SASS framework and Custom Meta Boxes, the scss folder can be deleted without theme changes, to remove the custom metaboxes remove lines 26-36 from the functions file.</p>
