<h3>A Lightweight Development Theme for WordPress</h3>
<code>Version: 1.0.1</code>

<p>Harmony is a bare bones developer focused theme which aims to be as minimalistic as possible.</p>

<h4>What's included?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A clean semantic HTML5 base</li>
  <li>Minimal functions.php file - just enough to make the theme work</li>
  <li>A stripped back, lightweight SASS framework</li>
  <li>Custom Meta Boxes</li>
  <li>Admin theme options base file</li>
</ul>

<p>Harmony is focused to fit perfectly into your workflow and as such GRUNT and other personal preferences have been left out</p>
