<h1>Harmony</h1>

<h3>A Lightweight Development Theme for WordPress</h3>
<code>Version: 1.0.1</code>

<p>Harmony is a bare bones developer focused theme which aims to be as minimalistic as possible.</p>

<h4>What's included?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A clean semantic HTML5 base</li>
  <li>Minimal functions.php file - just enough to make the theme work</li>
  <li>A stripped back, lightweight SASS framework</li>
  <li>Custom Meta Boxes</li>
  <li>Admin theme options base file</li>
</ul>

<p>Harmony is focused to fit perfectly into your workflow and as such GRUNT and other personal preferences have been left out</p>

<h4>Updates</h4>

<p>Harmony is a starter theme and as such it's a platform to build upon rather than a "complete" ready to ship theme.</p>

<p>Harmony will change, adapt and at times break backwards compatibility, the version number doesn't mean your theme is out of date and as such you shouldn't try to keep up to date, your theme will have evolved to a degree where merging our changes will cause conflicts.</p>
